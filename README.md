# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Introduction

The ETL project will be building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, it will create four CSV files and use the data in the CSV file to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you'll load the data from the CSV file into a Postgres database.

## Folders and files

  
* It is going to find a **folder** in this project:

   * The folder called `Resouces` will find 4 CSV files which were the exportable files of the exercise. The folder named `Resouces` will find 4 CSV files that were the exportable files of the exercise. And 2 xlsx files that are the original databases that the project had. Listed below are the names of the files you will find:
